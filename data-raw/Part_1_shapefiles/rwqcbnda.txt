COVERAGE DESCRIPTION:
  
The boundaries of the 9 California Regional Water Quality Control Boards are 
derived from watershed boundaries in the The California Watershed Map (CALWATER
version 2.2). Calwater 2.2 is a set of standardized watershed boundaries meeting 
standardized delineation criteria.

DATA QUALITY ASSESSMENT:
  
The following are subjective comments regarding this data.

The revised Regional Water Quality Control Board boundaries are derived from CALWATER
version 2.2. The data quality assessment for CALWATER 2.2 also applies to this coverage
and is as follows:
"CALWATER boundaries were digitized on a 1:24,000-scale base and thus very accurately
divide surface water features depicted on 1:100,000-scale Digital Line Graph 
hydrography.  However, CALWATER delineations are primarily designed to be 
administrative reporting units, and the boundaries should not be used to define
authoritative drainage area above a given point as a portion of their definition 
includes non-physical boundaries, particularly in valley floor and urbanized coastal 
regions. Attribute completeness is good. Compatibility with existing state and federal
watershed delineations is good, except where explicitly different boundary 
configurations are applied."
